## Running tests
**Keep in mind that tests are currently being developed, and tests that depend on missing features will automatically fail. If you add a missing feature, please remove the line of code that manually fails the tests.**

In one terminal:

```npm start```

And then, in another terminal:

```npm run test```

Running tests depends on a working Postgresql database. Message Thienn if you need help setting it up.
**All tests reset the postgresql database.**
